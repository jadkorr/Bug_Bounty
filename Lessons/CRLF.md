"Carriage Return Line Feed Injection" (CRLF Injection) is a web application vulnerability that occurs when an attacker can inject CRLF characters (carriage return and line feed) into input fields or HTTP headers. This injection can lead to various attacks such as HTTP response splitting, session fixation, cross-site scripting (XSS), and more.

### How it Works:
CRLF injection works by inserting special characters into input fields or HTTP headers to manipulate the intended behavior of the application or server. These characters include `%0D` for carriage return and `%0A` for line feed.

For example, if a web application fails to properly sanitize user input, an attacker could inject CRLF characters into an HTTP header like the `User-Agent`, `Referer`, or `Cookie` fields. This can result in malicious actions such as injecting additional headers, setting cookies, or manipulating the server's response.

### Testing for CRLF Injection:
To test for CRLF injection, you can use tools like Burp Suite, and OWASP ZAP, or simply craft your own HTTP requests using tools like cURL. Here's a basic example using cURL:

```bash
curl -v http://example.com -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0%0D%0AContent-Length: 0"
```

This sends a request to `example.com` with a manipulated `User-Agent` header, injecting a CRLF sequence after `Mozilla/5.0`.

### Bash Script for Testing CRLF Injection:
Here's a simple bash script to test for CRLF injection:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

URL="http://example.com"
HEADER="User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0%0D%0AContent-Length: 0"

curl -v $URL -H "$HEADER"
```

Replace `http://example.com` with the target URL you want to test.

### Prevention:
To prevent CRLF injection vulnerabilities, follow these best practices:

1. **Input Validation and Sanitization**: Validate and sanitize user input to ensure it does not contain CRLF characters.
2. **Encode Output**: Encode user input before outputting it to HTTP headers or responses.
3. **Use Framework Security Features**: Utilize security features provided by web frameworks to sanitize input and output automatically.
4. **Regular Security Audits**: Regularly audit your codebase for vulnerabilities, including CRLF injection.
5. **Update Libraries and Dependencies**: Keep libraries and dependencies up-to-date to mitigate known vulnerabilities.

Following these prevention measures can significantly reduce the risk of CRLF injection vulnerabilities in your web applications.

### Types of CRLF Injection:
There are several variations and specific contexts where CRLF injection can occur, including:

1. **HTTP Response Splitting**: Injecting CRLF characters into HTTP responses to manipulate subsequent responses or perform session fixation attacks.
2. **HTTP Header Injection**: Manipulating HTTP headers to perform various attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS) or injecting additional headers.
3. **Email Header Injection**: Similar to HTTP header injection, but targeting email headers in email-based attacks.
4. **FTP Command Injection**: Injecting CRLF characters into FTP commands to perform malicious actions on FTP servers.

Each type of CRLF injection requires specific techniques and prevention methods tailored to its context. Understanding these variations is crucial for effectively mitigating CRLF injection vulnerabilities in web applications.
